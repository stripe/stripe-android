/**
 * Controller implementation for a full screen component.
 *
 * The implementation to make this all work *well* is quite tricky and deserves some explanation.
 *
 * Goals
 * =====
 *  1. Configuration changes are handled well
 *  2. Process death is handled well
 *  3. API uses typical listener objects (no need for globals, broadcast receivers, etc.)
 *  4. API supports streaming events (not just final result)
 *  5. API enables easy programmatic dismissal
 *  6. No memory leaks (of course)
 *
 * There's a delicate dance between several classes. Here's what they are, their purpose, and their relationships:
 *
 * [EmbeddedComponentManager]
 * ==========================
 * The starting point. Users (i.e. SDK integrators) should either have a singleton or have Activity ViewModel scope
 * in order to survive configuration changes. Creates [StripeComponentController] and [StripeConnectWebViewContainer]
 * instances.
 *
 * [StripeComponentController]
 * ===========================
 * Creates and holds a single [StripeComponentDialogFragment] and provides APIs for its presentation and setting
 * the [StripeEmbeddedComponentListener]. The Controller also holds the [FragmentActivity] to display the DialogFragment
 * and therefore the Controller cannot outlive the Activity.
 *
 * The Controller also provides the [EmbeddedComponentManager] to the DialogFragment either directly (when it hasn't
 * been added to the Activity yet) or indirectly through [StripeComponentDialogFragmentViewModel]. In both cases,
 * [StripeComponentDialogFragmentViewModel] will hold onto the Manager for DialogFragment re-creation.
 *
 * [StripeComponentDialogFragment]
 * ===============================
 * Uses its provided [EmbeddedComponentManager] to create and render a [StripeConnectWebViewContainer], i.e. the
 * container view managing the [StripeConnectWebView]. The [EmbeddedComponentManager] instance is obtained in multiple
 * ways:
 *  1. From [StripeComponentController] upon creation. When attached to the Activity, the Manager is immediately
 *   stored in its [StripeComponentDialogFragmentViewModel] for persistence across config changes.
 *  2. From [StripeComponentDialogFragmentViewModel] upon re-creation after config changes.
 *  3. From [StripeComponentDialogFragmentViewModel] upon re-creation after app death. The VM will not immediately have
 *   the Manager instance, but the first thing [StripeComponentController] does after being created (it should be
 *   normally re-created if app state is restored properly) is set the Manager in the ViewModel if the DialogFragment
 *   has been added.
 *
 * [StripeComponentDialogFragmentViewModel]
 * ========================================
 * Its sole purpose is to retain an [EmbeddedComponentManager] instance to provide for [StripeComponentDialogFragment].
 *
 * [StripeEmbeddedComponentListener]
 * =================================
 * An interface for users to implement to listen to component events. Since Listeners may contain references to
 * Android app components (read: Activities), they must not be retained across config changes and must be re-set in
 * [StripeComponentDialogFragment] upon re-creation.
 *
 * [StripeConnectWebViewContainer], [StripeConnectWebViewContainerViewModel], & [StripeConnectWebView]
 * ===============================
 * Wraps and manages [StripeConnectWebView]. The WebView itself is actually created and retained by
 * [StripeConnectWebViewContainerViewModel] (see its docs for why). So upon configuration changes,
 * [StripeConnectWebViewContainer] is re-created but [StripeConnectWebView] is not -- it's simply re-added to the
 * re-created container view.
