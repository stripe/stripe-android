# Maestro tests

We use [Maestro](https://maestro.mobile.dev/) to run some instrumented tests.

## Writing tests

Add a new `yaml` file in the appropriate folder and test your flow using [the available commands](https://maestro.mobile.dev/api-reference/commands).

## Running tests

To run tests in a specific folder, run `maestro test {folder-with-tests}`.
