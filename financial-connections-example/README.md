end-to-end.

1. [Open the Glitch project](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/stripe-mobile-connections-example).
2. Click on "Remix", on the top right.
3. In your newly created project, open the `.env` file in the left sidebar.
4. Set your [Stripe testmode public and secret keys](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys) as

5. Your backend implementation should now be running. You can see the logs by clicking on "Logs" in
   the bottom bar.

#### Configure the app

1. If it doesn't exist, create a `gradle.properties` in a location defined in the
   [Gradle Build Environment docs](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_environment.html#sec:gradle_configuration_properties)
   .
   For example, the default location on macOS is `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`.
