# Stripe hCaptcha SDK

This is a modified version of the [hCaptcha SDK](https://github.com/hCaptcha/hcaptcha-android-sdk) specifically for use in the Stripe SDK. This SDK ensures that Stripe has control over the library directly and won't run into any lifecycle issues. This also translates the library to Kotlin.
