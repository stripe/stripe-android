# Stripe Android SDK

[![CI](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-android/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-android/actions?query=workflow%3ACI)
[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/stripe/stripe-android.svg?maxAge=60)](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-android/releases)
[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/stripe/stripe-android)](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-android/blob/master/LICENSE)

The Stripe Android SDK makes it quick and easy to build an excellent payment experience in your Android app. We provide powerful and customizable UI elements that can be used out-of-the-box to collect your users' payment details. We also expose the low-level APIs that power those UIs so that you can build fully custom experiences. 

Get started with our [ðŸ“š integration guides](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=android) and [example projects](#examples), or [ðŸ“˜ browse the SDK reference](https://stripe.dev/stripe-android/).

> Updating to a newer version of the SDK? See our [migration guide](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-android/blob/master/MIGRATING.md) and [changelog](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-android/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## Features

**Simplified Security**: Use the SDK to collect credit card numbers and remain [PCI compliant](https://stripe.com/docs/security#pci-dss-guidelines). This means sensitive data is sent directly to Stripe instead of passing through your server. For more information, see our [Integration Security Guide](https://stripe.com/docs/security).

**SCA-Ready**: The SDK automatically performs native [3D Secure authentication](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/3d-secure) to comply with [Strong Customer Authentication](https://stripe.com/docs/strong-customer-authentication) regulation in Europe.

**Native UI**: We provide native screens and elements to collect payment. For example, [PaymentSheet](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=android) is a prebuilt UI that combines all the steps required to pay - collecting payment details, and confirming the payment  - into a single sheet that displays on top of your app.

**Google Pay**: Stripe is fully compatible with [Google Pay](https://stripe.com/docs/google-pay).

**Stripe API**: We provide [low-level APIs](https://stripe.dev/stripe-android/stripe/com.stripe.android/-stripe/index.html) that correspond to objects and methods in the Stripe API. You can build a custom UI on top of this layer.

**Localized**: We support the following localizations: Bulgarian, Chinese (Hong Kong), Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Czech, Danish, Dutch, English (US), English (United Kingdom), Estonian, Finnish, French, French (Canada), German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Latvian, Lithuanian, Maltese, Norwegian BokmÃ¥l, Polish, Portuguese (Brazil), Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, Spanish (Latin America), Swedish, and Turkish.
